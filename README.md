## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am a first-year physics/astronomy (+ political science) undergraduate at the University of Washington, Seattle. This is my website to host my writing and store other projects. 

Here are some fun facts:
- I worked for NASA for a summer and spent a week in rural Texas at an observatory
- My middle name is from a video game
- I once correctly named every single Mii character

Here are some current projects: 
- Writing a screenplay for _These Other Americans_ by Laila Lalami
- Working on an album, _Thoughts from Places_
